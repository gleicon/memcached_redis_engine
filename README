redis engine for memcached
exercise over engine-pu API

- fetch memcached source code, engine-pu branch: https://github.com/memcached/memcached/tree/engine-pu
$ ./confih/autorun.sh
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/memcached
$ make all install
$ /opt/memcached/bin/memcached -E /opt//memcached/lib/memcached/default_engine.so

in a different term:

$ memcapable

All tests should pass. your memcached is ok and can switch backends. Now for fs_engine:

$ cd memcached_redis_engine

edit Makefile and make sure that hiredis is installed. mine is installed thru brew to test.

$ make clean all
$ /opt/memcached/bin/memcached -E redis_engine.so

in a different term

$ memcapable

currently get and set (store and get internally) are working.
most of redis ocnfigurations are hardcoded, lacks a connection pool, should use the async hiredis interface and clean up on the connection create/destroy.
there's also a concurrency bug when using memslap non-blocking.
